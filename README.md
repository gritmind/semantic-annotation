# Improving Classifier for Semantic Annotation of Software Requirements with Elaborate Syntactic Structure

## Dataset
Dataset for this research is [M.Dollmann et al. (2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1186)'s contribution because they manually constructed it (you can download it in [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dabiJGg96PrXJX0KsLRGvJNeMILG8rRt)). We converted .ann format (original) to a single .json file for modification and converted .json to .txt file (conll-format) for training models. Actually, such conversions were very tedious because there were many exceptions (cf. jupyer notebooks in dataset folder).




## Contribution
* Text preprocessing (rule list) for specific dataset (especially for improving the performance of parsers)
* Improve the model performance of previous research model, REaCT (Dollmann et al., 2016)
* Design new feature set modeled on Language Frame
* 

## Summary
* Stemming is better than lemmatization in our problem (cf. [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gritmind/semantic-annotation/blob/master/jupyter-notebook/stemming_vs_lemmatization.ipynb))
* Data cleaning/preprocessing, feature engineering are closely related to each other for both input and output to parsers.
* Elaborate syntactic features are based on tree sturcture (Constituency parser) and dependent type between two words (Dependency parser). We can distinguish all kinds of clauses by using dependent type (Dependency parser is more sensitive than Constituency in terms of grouping words).
