# Semantic Annotation of Software Requirements with Language Frame

## Dataset
Dataset for this research is [M.Dollmann et al. (2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1186)'s contribution because they manually constructed it (You can download it in [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dabiJGg96PrXJX0KsLRGvJNeMILG8rRt)). Since we converted (original) .ann format to .json format and merged multiple files, our dataset consist of a single json file. 



## Contribution
* Improve the model performance of previous research model, REaCT (Dollmann et al., 2016)
* Design new feature set modeled on Language Frame.
